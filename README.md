Tor-Browser Sandbox for macOS - security tool to reduce tor-browser access to macOS system

tbms is a script to allow macOS users to run TOR Browser inside Apple sandbox on Mac computers.
Sandboxing tor browser can help reduce risks related to exploits that can attack Firefox browser when browsing malicious sites.

NOTE: In no way tbms is going to secure tor browser from every possible exploit, it only helps to reduce tor browser access to your macOS resources, so it's just a marginal protection. However, sandboxing your browser does help to improve general security.

Please help me to improve this script with your suggestions and changes, thanks!
